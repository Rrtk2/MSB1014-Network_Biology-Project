#### What is this project about
With the era of high-throughput data, the amount of gene expression, microRNA expression, and methylation data has increased tremendously while the understanding of these regulatory mechanisms is lagging behind. (Epi)genetic dysregulation can lead to altered phenotypes such as cancer. Therefore, understanding the inference of these regulatory mechanisms is essential to treat or cure altered phenotypes. Little is known on how these regulating layers cooperate in detail. Methods to infer regulatory mechanisms from experimental and modelled datasets have been studied greatly and many methods have been developed. Network inference methods are widely used to improve understanding of complex regulatory networks. Literature-based information is often used to create the initial networks, such as pathways or protein-protein interaction networks. By combining network inference and literature-based information, the inferred networks possibly give new insight to the understanding of regulatory networks. By incorporating network motifs, topological significance is included in the analysis. This results in a combined effort of information driven (all genes in model are known), network inference (inference based on in sillico data) and topological information (network motifs) to predict the true inference of the model.
This project aims to estimate the improvement of network inference of regulatory networks by using network motifs.
